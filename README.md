# 📦 Weight Converter 📦

This is a simple weight converter tool built in Python. It allows users to input their weight in either kilograms or pounds and get the equivalent weight in the other unit of measurement.

# 🚀 Getting Started
To use the weight converter, simply run the Python script. You will be prompted to enter your weight and specify the unit of measurement. The program will then convert the weight and display the result.

# 📝 Usage

1. Run the script in your preferred Python environment.
2. Enter your weight in whole numbers when prompted.
3. Enter either "L" or "K" to specify pounds or kilograms, respectively.
4. The program will output the converted weight in the opposite unit of measurement.

# 🤖 Technical Details
The program is written in Python and utilizes basic arithmetic operations to convert the weight. It includes a try-except block to handle invalid inputs. The conversion formula used is 1 kilogram = 2.205 pounds.

# 💡 Tips

- Make sure to enter whole numbers for weight.
    
- Double check that you have entered the correct unit of measurement (L for pounds, K for kilograms).
    
- If you encounter an error message, check that your input is valid and try again.
